# EWHQ Admin Portal Implementation Plan

## Overview
The EWHQ Admin Portal is a comprehensive management system for administrators and team members. The system uses a **hierarchical permission model** with team-based access control, allowing different levels of access based on user roles.

## Permission Hierarchy

### 1. **Team Member** (Standard User)
- Can view/create/edit/delete their own Companies, Brands, and Shops
- Cannot access team management features
- Sees only "Dashboard" and "Client Management" in navigation

### 2. **Team Leader**
- Inherits all Team Member permissions
- Can view and manage members in their team (invite/remove/change roles)
- Can access "Teams" section to view their team
- Cannot create, edit, or delete teams
- Sees "Teams & Users" â†’ "Teams" in navigation

### 3. **Admin** (Distributor/Reseller)
- Inherits all Team Leader permissions
- Can create new teams
- Can edit and delete teams they created
- Can view all users in the system
- Sees full "Teams & Users" section (Teams, All Users, Invitations)

### 4. **Super Admin**
- Full system access
- Can view and manage ALL teams, users, companies, brands, and shops
- No restrictions on any operations

## Recent Updates (2025-07-13)

### Authorization System Enhancement
- âœ… Fixed issue where team members could access admin functions
- âœ… Implemented proper permission hierarchy
- âœ… Added ProfileController for user team data
- âœ… Enhanced frontend role checking with `isTeamLeader()` method
- âœ… Updated sidebar to show/hide sections based on permissions

### UI/UX Improvements
- âœ… Team Leaders now see only relevant menu items
- âœ… "Create Team" button hidden from non-admin users
- âœ… "Edit/Delete Team" options restricted to admins
- âœ… Improved loading states for async operations

### User Management Features (Phase 5)
- âœ… Implemented All Users page with DataTable
- âœ… Created UsersController with comprehensive API endpoints
- âœ… Added server-side pagination, search, and filtering
- âœ… Implemented user activation/deactivation using lockout

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Performance**: Team data is fetched separately from auth, causing slight delay
2. **Caching**: No caching implemented for team/user data
3. **Real-time**: No WebSocket support for live updates
4. **Search**: Limited search functionality across entities

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Check user permissions in both frontend and backend
2. Use RoleProtectedRoute for page-level protection
3. Hide UI elements based on user roles/permissions
4. Always validate permissions on the backend
5. Follow the established permission hierarchy

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test as Team Member - verify limited access
- [ ] Test as Team Leader - verify team management
- [ ] Test as Admin - verify team creation/editing
- [ ] Test as Super Admin - verify full access
- [ ] Test invitation flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test permission denial scenarios
